<p><DD>If you arrive in Amsterdam by train you might wonder what that big green bow of a ship is doing sticking out of the water like that. Well, it’s not actually a ship, but NEMO, a science museum for kids (or the young at heart) in Amsterdam that aims to bring science and technology closer to the public in an interactive way. </p></DD>

<p><DD>This museum wouldn’t be truly Dutch if it didn’t have a lot of content related to wind and water. Wandering around this interactive museum, you’ll come across a range of exhibits about generating renewable energy using wind and water. In the Water Power exhibit, for example, you can build your own dam to create green energy. </p></DD>

<p><DD>It’s not just wind and energy that gets explored at NEMO though; you can also conduct your own chemistry experiments, learn about life in the universe or become a logistics expert sending parcels all around the world.</p></DD>
