<p><DD>The Universeum in Sweden aims to be a space where everyone can learn about science and technology, through play. It explores pretty much everything from the Big Bang and biodiversity to artificial intelligence and it does it all in an immersive and interactive way. </p></DD>

<p><DD>The aquariums in this interactive museum are among the biggest in the world. You will walk in a tunnel that leads straight through the aquarium, and observe sharks, rays, and clownfish from below. When you’ve seen enough fish to last you a while, you can move on to the Reptilarium to meet some venomous snakes and learn how they have helped humans make discoveries in technology, physics, chemistry and medicine. </p></DD>

<p><DD>There’s a lot to learn about humans here too though! In the Health exhibit you can challenge your friend’s to a stamina contest and find out if you can react as fast as Bayern Munich players. When all this earthly stuff starts to bore you, just take off into the universe in the Space exhibit.</p></DD>
