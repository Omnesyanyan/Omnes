<p><DD>The museum’s latest exhibition illustrates its commitment to being a modern museum planted firmly in the present. In response to Covid-19 they have created a timely digital exhibition exploring Singapore’s history of public health. The exhibit uses historical examples of social-distancing measures and contact-tracing to show that many of the measures taken today have their roots in the past. You can access the exhibition for free on the museum’s website.</p></DD>
