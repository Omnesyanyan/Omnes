<p><DD>SPYSCAPE New York is a dream come true for anyone who aspires to replace Daniel Craig in the role of the world’s most famous spy. In this highly interactive museum you’ll get a chance to explore your own spying skills. 

All of the spies featured at Spyscape are real, so James Bond won’t make an appearance, but you’ll learn all about shadowy figures like Robert Hanssen, a former FBI special agent who sold secrets to the Russians, or the famous teenager who hacked the CIA.</p></DD>

<p><DD>In the meantime, your own spying merits will be assessed through a Profiling System developed by a former member of the British intelligence service. After a series of interactive challenges you’ll come out knowing the kind of spy that hides within you. Are you a “Spymaster”? Or could you put your skills to better use as a “Hacker” or a “Cryptologist”?</p></DD>
