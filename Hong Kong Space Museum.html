<p><DD>The interactive Hong Kong Space Museum is housed in one of the most famous landmarks in Hong Kong and takes pride in the fact that at least 70% of its exhibits are interactive.

The museum is divided into the Hall of the Cosmos and the Hall of Space Exploration.</p></DD>

<p><DD>As the name suggests, the “Hall of the Cosmos” explores the Universe, and allows you to travel through the Milky Way, past stars and planets to galaxies far away. In the interactive exhibit Gravity Surfing, you’ll stand on a surfing board, defying gravity and taking in the sights of celestial objects flying past.</p></DD>

<p><DD>The “Hall of Space Exploration” on the first floor delves into the development of space exploration and space technology. In the Docking in Space exhibit you can test your ability to control a space vehicle and make it dock with the International Space Station.</p></DD>
